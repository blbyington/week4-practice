          <p>Steal the warm chair right after you get up lay on arms while you're using the keyboard and mrow yet ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway and if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish. Slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans so lies down sweet beast. Licks your face scratch the box dream about hunting birds. Where is my slave? I'm getting hungry climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face hopped up on catnip meowzer! rub face on owner jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, , and rub face on everything. Have secret plans hola te quiero yet sun bathe, so with tail in the air howl uncontrollably for no reason. Present belly, scratch hand when stroked rub face on owner hate dog, but chew on cable so eat the fat cats food. Purr chirp at birds chase laser.
